[Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. The name of the project is a play on words which stands for Client for URLs.

I've mainly being using it as a really lightweight way to test REST apis.

You can simply run the following...

`curl <URL>`

You can specify the HTTP verb (default is GET) like so:

`-X <POST|PUT|PATCH|OPTIONS|...>`

Note that you can specify the format of the response using an accept header input parameter like so...

`-H "Accept: application/<xml|json>"`

To format xml output, pipe your curl command into the following command...

`xmllint --format -`

To format json output, pipe it into the following command...

`json_pp`

You can specify authentication mechanisms. For example, for basic login mechanisms, add this to your command...

`--basic --user <username>:<password>`

When doing a POST request, you can specify the body content type like so...

`-H "Content-Type: application/<json|x-www-form-urlencoded>"`

When the content type is `application/json`, you can specify the body like so...

`-d '{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}'`

When the content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencded` (which is the default content type for post requests), you can specify the body like so...

`-d key1=value1&key2=value2`
