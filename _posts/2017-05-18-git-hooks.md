[Curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs. The name of the project is a play on words which stands for Client for URLs.

I've mainly being using it as a really lightweight way to test REST apis.

You can simply run the following...

`curl <URL>`

You can specify the HTTP verb (default is GET) like so:

`-X <POST|PUT|PATCH|OPTIONS|...>`

To format xml output, pipe your curl command into the following command...

`xmllint --format -`

To format json output, pipe it into the following command...

`json_pp`

Note that you can specify the format of the response using an accept header input parameter like so...

`-H "Accept: application/<xml|json>"`

You can specify authentication mechanisms. For example, for basic login mechanisms, add this to your command...

`--basic --user <username>:<password>`
