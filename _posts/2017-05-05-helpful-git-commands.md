I've decided to keep a dump of helpful git commands I come across for reference.

```
git reset [--<soft|mixed|hard>] branch

  --soft - Current changes remain and are staged
  --mixed - Current changes remain but are not staged
  --soft - Current changes do not remain  
```

```
git <...> --no-verify

  Bypasses any git hooks
```
